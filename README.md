## Overview

**Ramparts** is a scanner designed for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** ecosystem. As AI agents and LLMs increasingly rely on external tools and resources through MCP servers, ensuring the security of these connections has become critical.   

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to external data sources and tools. It allows AI agents to access databases, file systems, and APIs through toolcalling to retrieve real-time information and interact with external or internal services.

Ramparts is under active development. Read our [launch blog](https://www.getjavelin.com/blogs/ramparts-mcp-scan).

### The Security Challenge

MCP servers expose powerful capabilities‚Äîfile systems, databases, APIs, and system commands‚Äîthat can become attack vectors like tool poisoning, command injection, and data exfiltration without proper security analysis.

üìö **[Security Features & Attack Vectors](docs/security-features.md)** - Complete guide to 11+ vulnerabilities detected

### What Ramparts Does

Ramparts provides **security scanning** of MCP servers by:

1. **Discovering Capabilities**: Scans all MCP endpoints to identify available tools, resources, and prompts
2. **Static Analysis**: Performs yara-based checks for common vulnerabilities
3. **Cross-Origin Analysis**: Detects when tools span multiple domains, which could enable context hijacking or injection attacks
4. **LLM-Powered Analysis**: Uses AI models to detect sophisticated security issues
5. **Risk Assessment**: Categorizes findings by severity and provides actionable recommendations


## Who Ramparts is For

Scan MCP servers for vulnerabilities in your development environment (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code) or production deployments. 

**For MCP users**: Scan third-party servers before connecting, validate local servers before production.

**For MCP developers**: Ensure your tools, resources, and prompts don't expose vulnerabilities to AI agents.

## Key Features

Comprehensive MCP security scanning with 11+ attack vector detection, YARA-X integration, CLI/API interfaces, and flexible configuration options.

üìñ **[Complete Feature List & CLI Reference](docs/cli.md)** - All commands, options, and capabilities  

## Use Cases

- **Security Audits**: Comprehensive assessment of MCP server security posture
- **Development**: Testing MCP servers during development and testing phases  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated security scanning in deployment pipelines
- **Compliance**: Meeting security requirements for AI agent deployments

> **Important**: Ramparts analyzes MCP server metadata and static configurations. For comprehensive security, combine with runtime MCP guardrails and adopt a layered security approach. The MCP threat landscape is rapidly evolving.

## Installation

**From crates.io (Recommended)**
```bash
# With YARA-X support (recommended)
cargo install ramparts

# Without YARA-X support (lighter installation)
cargo install ramparts --no-default-features
```

**From source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/getjavelin/ramparts.git
cd ramparts

# With YARA-X support
cargo install --path .

# Without YARA-X support
cargo install --path . --no-default-features
```

> **Note**: YARA-X provides advanced pattern-based security scanning and can be disabled via configuration if needed.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

**Scan an MCP server**
```bash
ramparts scan https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/ --auth-headers "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

**Scan with custom output format**
```bash
ramparts scan <url> --output json
ramparts scan <url> --output raw
```

**Scan with verbose output**
```bash
ramparts scan <url> --verbose
```
