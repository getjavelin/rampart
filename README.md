## Overview

**Ramparts** is a scanner designed for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** ecosystem. As AI agents and LLMs increasingly rely on external tools and resources through MCP servers, ensuring the security of these connections has become critical.   

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to external data sources and tools. It allows AI agents to access databases, file systems, and APIs through toolcalling to retrieve real-time information and interact with external or internal services.

Ramparts is under active development. Read our [launch blog](https://www.getjavelin.com/blogs/ramparts-mcp-scan).

### The Security Challenge

MCP servers can expose powerful capabilities to AI agents, including:
- **File system access** (read/write files, directory traversal)
- **Database operations** (SQL queries, data manipulation)
- **API integrations** (external/internal/local service calls, authentication)
- **System commands** (process execution, system administration)

Without proper security analysis, these capabilities can become attack vectors for:
- **Tool Poisoning** - bypassing AI safety measures
- **MCP Rug Pulls** - unauthorized changes to MCP tool descriptions after initial user approval
- **Cross-Origin Escalation** - exploiting tools across multiple domains to hijack context or inject malicious content
- **Data exfiltration** - leaking sensitive information
- **Privilege escalation** - gaining unauthorized access
- **Path traversal attacks** - accessing files outside intended directories
- **Command injection** - executing unauthorized system commands
- **SQL injection** - manipulating database queries

### What Ramparts Does

Ramparts provides **security scanning** of MCP servers by:

1. **Discovering Capabilities**: Scans all MCP endpoints to identify available tools, resources, and prompts
2. **Static Analysis**: Performs yara-based checks for common vulnerabilities
3. **Cross-Origin Analysis**: Detects when tools span multiple domains, which could enable context hijacking or injection attacks
4. **LLM-Powered Analysis**: Uses AI models to detect sophisticated security issues
5. **Risk Assessment**: Categorizes findings by severity and provides actionable recommendations


## Who Ramparts is For

Ramparts is designed for developers using local, remote MCP servers or building their own MCP servers and interested in scanning it for any vulnerabilities it may expose. Developers may use Ramparts locally to scan the MCP servers they use in their local development environment (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code etc.,). 

**If you're using MCP servers** - whether they're running locally on your machine or hosted remotely - Ramparts helps you understand what security risks they might pose. You can scan third-party MCP servers before connecting to them, or validate your own local MCP servers before deploying them to production.

**If you're building MCP servers** - whether you're creating tools, resources, or prompts - Ramparts gives you confidence that your implementation doesn't expose vulnerabilities to AI agents. It's especially useful for developers who want to ensure their MCP tools are secure by design.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive MCP Coverage**: Analyzes all MCP endpoints and evaluates each tool, resource, and prompt
- **Advanced Security Detection**: Detects 11+ attack vectors using static checks and LLM-assisted analysis
- **YARA-X Integration**: Optional advanced pattern-based scanning with configurable rules
- **High Performance**: Built in Rust for fast, efficient scanning with minimal memory overhead
- **Multiple Interfaces**: CLI tool, REST API server, and batch processing capabilities
- **Rich Output Formats**: Text, JSON, and raw formats for integration with scripts and dashboards
- **Flexible Configuration**: IDE integration, custom YAML configs, and extensible rule system

> **Built with Rust** for performance, reliability, and portability. Compiles to a single binary for easy deployment in CI pipelines, agent sandboxes, and constrained environments.  

## Use Cases

- **Security Audits**: Comprehensive assessment of MCP server security posture
- **Development**: Testing MCP servers during development and testing phases  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated security scanning in deployment pipelines
- **Compliance**: Meeting security requirements for AI agent deployments

> **Important**: Ramparts analyzes MCP server metadata and static configurations. For comprehensive security, combine with runtime MCP guardrails and adopt a layered security approach. The MCP threat landscape is rapidly evolving.

## Installation

**From crates.io (Recommended)**
```bash
# With YARA-X support (recommended)
cargo install ramparts

# Without YARA-X support (lighter installation)
cargo install ramparts --no-default-features
```

**From source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/getjavelin/ramparts.git
cd ramparts

# With YARA-X support
cargo install --path .

# Without YARA-X support
cargo install --path . --no-default-features
```

> **Note**: YARA-X provides advanced pattern-based security scanning and can be disabled via configuration if needed.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

**Scan an MCP server**
```bash
ramparts scan https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/ --auth-headers "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

**Scan with custom output format**
```bash
ramparts scan <url> --output json
ramparts scan <url> --output raw
```

**Scan with verbose output**
```bash
ramparts scan <url> --verbose
```
