# Security Features & Attack Vector Detection

This document provides detailed information about the security vulnerabilities and attack vectors that Ramparts detects when scanning MCP servers.

## Overview

Ramparts provides comprehensive security analysis of MCP servers by detecting various attack vectors that could compromise AI agents, systems, or data. The scanner uses a combination of static analysis, YARA-X pattern matching, and LLM-powered analysis to identify security issues.

## Attack Vectors Detected

### Tool Poisoning

**Description**: Tool Poisoning attacks involve bypassing AI safety measures by manipulating MCP tool descriptions or behaviors to perform unauthorized or malicious actions.

**How it works**:
- Malicious actors provide tools with misleading descriptions
- Tools appear benign but perform harmful operations
- AI agents unknowingly execute dangerous commands
- Safety measures are circumvented through deceptive tool metadata

**Detection methods**:
- Analyzing tool descriptions for misleading or deceptive language
- Comparing actual tool functionality with stated purpose
- Detecting tools that perform operations beyond their stated scope
- Identifying tools with overly broad or vague descriptions

**Example scenarios**:
- A "file viewer" tool that actually modifies or deletes files
- A "data retrieval" tool that exfiltrates sensitive information
- A "formatting" tool that executes system commands

### MCP Rug Pulls

**Description**: MCP Rug Pulls occur when tool descriptions or implementations are changed after initial user approval, leading to unauthorized behavior.

**How it works**:
- User approves tools based on initial descriptions
- Tool implementations are subsequently modified
- New behavior differs from originally approved functionality
- Users remain unaware of the changes

**Detection methods**:
- Monitoring for discrepancies between tool descriptions and implementations
- Detecting tools with multiple or conflicting descriptions
- Identifying tools that perform actions not mentioned in their metadata
- Flagging tools with overly generic or changeable descriptions

**Example scenarios**:
- A tool that initially reads files but later gains write capabilities
- A tool that expands its scope from local to remote operations
- A tool that adds authentication bypass after approval

### Cross-Origin Escalation

**Description**: Cross-Origin Escalation attacks exploit tools that access resources across multiple domains, creating opportunities for context hijacking and injection attacks.

**How it works**:
- Tools span multiple domains or origins
- One domain injects malicious content affecting tools on other domains
- Mixed security schemes (HTTP/HTTPS) create vulnerabilities
- Domain contamination spreads security risks across tools

**Detection methods**:
- Comprehensive URL analysis across all tools and resources
- Extracting and normalizing domains from tool parameters, schemas, and metadata
- Identifying cross-domain contamination patterns
- Flagging outlier tools using different domains than the majority
- Detecting mixed HTTP/HTTPS schemes

**Cross-Origin Analysis Features**:
- **Context Hijacking Detection**: Identifies when tools from different domains could affect each other's context
- **Domain Contamination Analysis**: Detects when untrusted domains mix with trusted ones
- **Security Scheme Validation**: Flags mixed HTTP/HTTPS usage that could compromise security
- **Outlier Domain Detection**: Identifies tools using domains different from the server majority

**Example scenarios**:
- Tools accessing both internal corporate resources and external APIs
- Mixed HTTP and HTTPS endpoints in the same tool set
- Tools using different authentication domains
- Resources spanning multiple cloud providers or regions

### Data Exfiltration

**Description**: Data exfiltration vulnerabilities allow unauthorized extraction of sensitive information from systems or databases.
